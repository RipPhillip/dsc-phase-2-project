    "The goal of this project is to look into the King County, Washington housing market from the perspective of a home buyer, potentially a first time home buyer.  Through EDA (exploratory data analysis) and linear regression models, I hope to find the features most relevant to the cost of a home in the King County market. "

    "# Data and methods\n",
    "Based on the sourced data of King County, Washington's housing market, we find these as the variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "![vars](Screen.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a lot of data scrubbing involved due to a multitude of outliers in some key variables:\n",
    "* Bathrooms\n",
    "* Bedrooms\n",
    "* Price\n",
    "* Sqft_lot\n",
    "\n",
    "The box plots for each were as follows, pre-scrubbing:\n",
    "**Bedrooms above 5 were dropped**\n",
    "![bed](bedroom_outliers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prices above 1.5 million were dropped**\n",
    "![price](price_outliers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bathrooms above 4 were dropped**\n",
    "![bath](bathroom_outliers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sqft_lot above 100,000 were dropped**\n",
    "![sqft](sqft_lot_outliers.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After dropping these outliers, the data was much easier to manage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I created a heat map to see where there was collinearity:\n",
    "![heat](heat_map.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I made a covariance matrix heat map to find the variables that had the highest correlation to price:\n",
    "\n",
    "![covar](covar.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this information, we see that grade, bathrooms, bedrooms, sqft_living and sqft_living15 have the highest correlation to price.  Given that sqft_living and sqft_above have such a collinearity between each other, sqft_above was dropped. \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to create a few different models: the first where I didn't transform the data at all and just did a linear regression based on the cleaned data. The second where I standardized the data.  The third where I log-transformed the data. \n",

    "# Results\n",
    "\n",

The dates are varying darkness of blue and red to show a skew towards the lower and higher end, respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "![map](map.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the models, I found with the first model that there was an RMSE (root mean squared error) of about $160,000.  I am using this number because with my best and model, the standardized data model, I also standardized the MSE (mean squared error) and RMSE of the price.  I was able to get an R-squared of .597 with this model and a Jarque-Bera of 100.437.  My QQ plot looked as follows:\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data and models, we see that grade and sqft_living have the highest effect on the price of a home.  Whereas, after a house has 3 or 4 bedrooms, the price begins to tail off. \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue I ran into is one mentioned before, where my RMSE and MSE prices were transformed and thus, gave a very small number.  So, given that, I went with the RMSE of the first, non-transformed model. \n",

    "* Gather more data on housing, especially more data on the expensive houses so as to create a better analysis of the overall market. \n",
    "* Develop a new model that standardizes the data, but doesn't perform a transformation on the price that I can't sort out how to reverse without completely re-engineering the model and data.\n",
    "* Perform more EDA on the features.  See what's affecting the R-squared values the most. "
